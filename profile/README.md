## Welcome to the Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group 
[Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se)

Our research spans three key areas advancing automation, digitalization, and distributed computing:

**Systems of Systems**: Architecting complex automation solutions using microsystem and microservice paradigms. Our research group is the principal contributor to the [Eclipse Arrowhead](https://arrowhead.eu/eclipse-arrowhead-2/) project.

**Distributed Systems**: Blockchain technologies, smart contracts and security research, including the ScaleGraph blockchain, and cloud computing research, including the development of [ColonyOS]([link](https://colonyos.io)) for distributed computing across cloud and edge environments,

**Electronics and Software Integration**: From high-density circuit board interconnects to chiplet design and computational hardware integration within microsystem/microservice frameworks.
